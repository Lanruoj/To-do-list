## Concept:
*To-do list app*
First, it greets the user with the day/date/time and displays that day's tasks in the format of a to-do list sorted by deadline times (unless the list is empty). Then, users can:
1. Choose an option for what to do
2. Add a task from user input (with time added and optional deadline time)
3. Mark tasks as done
4. Delete tasks
5. View completed tasks
7. Gracefully quit program
