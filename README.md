## Concept:
*To-do list app*
First, it greets the user with the day/date/time and displays that day's tasks in the format of a to-do list (unless the list is empty). Then, users can:
1. Choose an option for what to do
2. Add tasks from user input (with time added and deadline times)
3. Mark tasks as done
4. Delete tasks
5. View completed tasks
6. View remaining tasks, sorted by deadline
7. Gracefully quit program (and retain information from that day - clear information at end of each day)
