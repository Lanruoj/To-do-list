# **Tracks** - *a task manager for the unorganised*
**Author**: Tan√© Kaio

## Concept
If you're anything like me, you need help with keeping track of your daily tasks to stay organised and ensure things are done on time. This app allows us to keep a list of our daily tasks, sorted by the time we need them done by. When we complete a task we can mark it as done, then view all of those completed tasks to remind ourselves of how productive we are! Seeing what we've accomplished is a very rewarding experience and is essential to remain motivated, so I believe we should focus on our past achievements as much as what we're working on for the future.
