## Concept
****
If you're anything like me, you need help with keeping track of your daily tasks to stay organised and ensure things are done on time. This app allows us to keep a list of our daily tasks, sorted by the time we need them done by. When we complete a task we can mark it as done, then view all of those completed tasks to remind ourselves of how productive we are! Seeing what we've accomplished is a very rewarding experience and is essential to remain motivated, so I believe we should focus on our past achievements as much as what we're working on for the future.
